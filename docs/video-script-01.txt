[INTRO — 0:00–0:30]
---------------------

VISUAL: World map slowly rotating, countries lighting up with colors

VOICEOVER:
"What makes a country truly prosperous? It's not just money.
We analyzed 125 countries across 12 dimensions — from governance
and security to education, health, innovation, and housing.
Each country scored 0 to 100. Here are the top 10 most
prosperous countries in 2026."

VISUAL: Quick flash of all 12 pillar icons with names

VOICEOVER:
"Stay until the end — number one might surprise you.
And the gap between the richest and poorest is staggering."


[#10 — AUSTRIA — 0:30–1:10]
-----------------------------

VISUAL: Austria highlighted on map, flag, score "84.2" animating in

VOICEOVER:
"Number 10 — Austria, with an overall score of 84.2.
Austria excels in healthcare, scoring 91 out of 100 — one of the
highest in the world. Strong education at 88, solid governance
at 85. But like most countries on this list, housing is its
weakest point at 74. Even the best countries struggle with
affordable housing."

VISUAL: Bar chart of Austria's 12 pillars, health bar highlighted


[#9 — GERMANY — 1:10–1:50]
-----------------------------

VISUAL: Germany highlighted, flag, score "84.4"

VOICEOVER:
"Number 9 — Germany at 84.4. Europe's largest economy leads in
innovation, scoring an impressive 91. World-class infrastructure
at 90, strong healthcare at 88. But Germany too has a housing
problem — scoring just 72. If you've ever tried finding an
apartment in Berlin or Munich, you know exactly why."

VISUAL: Bar chart with innovation bar highlighted


[#8 — SINGAPORE — 1:50–2:35]
------------------------------

VISUAL: Singapore highlighted, flag, score "84.6"

VOICEOVER:
"Number 8 — Singapore at 84.6. The only Asian country in the
top 10 — and for good reason. Singapore has the highest
infrastructure score on the entire list at 96. Security is 92,
economy at 88. This tiny city-state punches way above its weight.
But there's a trade-off: equity scores just 68. Prosperity in
Singapore is real, but not equally shared."

VISUAL: Bar chart, infrastructure bar towers above others, equity highlighted low


[#7 — NETHERLANDS — 2:35–3:10]
--------------------------------

VISUAL: Netherlands highlighted, flag, score "85.5"

VOICEOVER:
"Number 7 — the Netherlands at 85.5. Infrastructure leads at 94 —
the Dutch have been engineering their environment for centuries.
Innovation scores 90, governance 88. And like their neighbors,
housing is the weakest link at 68. A pattern is emerging."

VISUAL: Bar chart with housing bar visually dipping


[#6 — SWITZERLAND — 3:10–3:55]
---------------------------------

VISUAL: Switzerland highlighted, flag, score "87.8"

VOICEOVER:
"Number 6 — Switzerland at 87.8. The innovation capital of Europe,
scoring an incredible 96 — the highest innovation score of any
country on this list. Healthcare at 94, economy at 90. Switzerland
is almost flawless on paper. Almost. Housing scores just 65 —
the lowest housing score in the entire top 10. Anyone who's seen
Zurich rent prices understands."

VISUAL: Bar chart, innovation at 96 highlighted, housing dip emphasized


[#5 — DENMARK — 3:55–4:30]
-----------------------------

VISUAL: Denmark highlighted, flag, score "89.7"

VOICEOVER:
"Number 5 — Denmark at 89.7. Now we enter the Nordic zone.
Governance at 95, education at 92, health at 90. Denmark is
one of the most balanced countries in the world — no pillar
scores below 80. The Danes consistently rank among the happiest
people on Earth, and the data shows why."

VISUAL: Bar chart — all bars high, very balanced profile


[#4 — ICELAND — 4:30–5:05]
-----------------------------

VISUAL: Iceland highlighted, flag, score "89.8"

VOICEOVER:
"Number 4 — Iceland at 89.8. A population of just 380,000 people,
yet one of the most prosperous nations on the planet. Energy scores
98 — almost perfect — thanks to 100% renewable geothermal and
hydropower. Security at 95, governance at 94. The weakest pillar?
Innovation at 78 — hard to build a tech industry on a volcanic
island in the middle of the Atlantic."

VISUAL: Energy bar nearly at 100, dramatic contrast with innovation


[#3 — FINLAND — 5:05–5:40]
-----------------------------

VISUAL: Finland highlighted, flag, score "89.8"

VOICEOVER:
"Number 3 — Finland, also at 89.8, tied with Iceland. Finland's
governance score of 96 ties with Norway for the highest in the
world. Education at 94 — the Finnish school system is legendary
for a reason. Healthcare at 90, security at 92. Finland proves
that investing in people pays off."

VISUAL: Bar chart, governance and education highlighted


[#2 — SWEDEN — 5:40–6:15]
----------------------------

VISUAL: Sweden highlighted, flag, score "89.9"

VOICEOVER:
"Number 2 — Sweden at 89.9. Just one tenth of a point behind
number one. Governance at 94, innovation at 90, education at 92.
Sweden is the most balanced country in this ranking — every single
pillar scores above 82. No real weaknesses. The Swedish model of
combining a strong welfare state with a competitive economy
continues to deliver results."

VISUAL: Bar chart — all bars uniformly high, "lowest: 82" label


[#1 — NORWAY — 6:15–7:00]
----------------------------

VISUAL: Dramatic reveal — Norway highlighted, flag, score "91.7" with crown icon

VOICEOVER:
"And number 1 — Norway, with an overall score of 91.7. The most
prosperous country in the world in 2026. Governance: 96. Security:
94. Education: 92. Health: 92. Even its weakest pillar — innovation
at 85 — would be the strongest pillar in most countries. Norway's
combination of oil wealth, democratic institutions, and social
investment creates a level of prosperity that no other nation
matches. The gap between Norway at 91.7 and the lowest-ranked
country — DR Congo at 18.8 — is 73 points. That's the world
we live in."

[OUTRO — 7:00–7:40]
---------------------

VISUAL: All 10 countries shown on map, scores next to them

VOICEOVER:
"So what did we learn? The Nordic countries dominate — five of the
top ten. Housing is a weakness even for the richest nations.
And Singapore proves that geography doesn't determine destiny.
